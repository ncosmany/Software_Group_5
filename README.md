**Risks to Project Completion**  

1. A large number of possible features could lead to snowballing task numbers.  
2. Limited timeframe, needs to be completed by the end of the semester.  
3. Lack of previous knowledge, first time building an inventory management system.  
4. Potential time constraints, jobs, other classes.  
5. Lack of experience in SQL implementation.  

**Mitigation Strategy for Above Risks**  

1. Clear direction and agreement on included features.  
2. Sprints have clear objectives and deadlines are met.  
3. Research and sharing knowledge in team meetings.  
4. Adapting to the plan as needed to ensure quality over quantity.
